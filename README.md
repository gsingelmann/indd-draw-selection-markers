# Draw Selection Markers

If you write manuals for things you do in InDesign you might benefit from this script.

It draws the lines and rectangles that indicate the selected frame. Thus you can create a text frame, fill it with text, run the script and it looks in the printed result as if the text frame was selected. Graphic frames work as well.

### Startup Scripts

Some scripts are declared as "Startup Scripts". These are scripts that are automatically run, right after InDesign starts.

For those simply create a folder with the name "Startup Scripts" right beside the "Scripts Panel" folder and place the script inside.

### Storing scripts somewhere else

The "Scripts Panel" folder is located in preferences folder of your current InDesign-Version.

I have installed several versions of InDesign (since the customer and his version is "always right" ;) ) but I want to have a single installation folder that is shared among the InDesign-versions.

It used to be that an alias was good enough for this purpose but that changed a few years ago. Now you need something that is called a [symbolic link](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115646/how-can-i-create-a-symbolic-link-in-terminal).

1. Find the Terminal in Application:Utilities:
1. Open the folder that contains the folder where you want to store your scripts
1. Drag the folder-symbol in the window bar onto the Terminal

![open folder in terminal](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/04-open-terminal.jpg)

By dragging the folder onto the terminal that folder is automatically set as 'current folder' so you donâ€™t have to bother about paths.

4. Now type `ln -s nameofsourcefolder nameofsymboliclink`

In my example:

``` bash
ln -s my\ real\ scripts\ folder/ my-scripts
```

![symbolic link](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/05-link.jpg)

5. Drag the link (here: `my-scripts`) into your "Scripts Panel" folder

### Folder Structure

Instead of simply putting all your scripts flat into the Scripts Panel you can create a folder structure.

![folders](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/06-structure.jpg)

The Scripts panel will show the same structure:
